  It is a nice minimal way of showing that the message has been sent.

##### What model device did you test your application on? What SDK did you target? #####
> I tested in the emulator as usual, this time two emulators since we had to test SMS. Both were nexus 4 with sdk 23.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####

##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Problems with running 2 emulators at the same time on windows. I had to install XAHM through android studio and configure (by reinstalling it
   through command shell on windows ) it to upgrade memory size to 4 GB. This will be helpful for future Windows users for this assignment
   who want to work solo.
